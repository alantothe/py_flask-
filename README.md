#### Project Overview
This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface to explore and learn about various wines while also challenging your knowledge of wine regions. It consists of a RESTful API built with Flask, a PostgreSQL database to store wine information, and a command line application for interactive guessing games.

#### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-api-project.git
cd wine-api-project
```

Create a virtual environment (recommended) and activate it:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the database configuration in config.py:

```
DATABASE = {
    'name': 'your_db_name',
    'user': 'your_db_user',
    'password': 'your_db_password',
    'host': 'localhost',
    'port': '5432',
}
```

Initialize the database and populate it with sample data:

```
python manage.py create_tables
python manage.py seed_data
```

#### Usage
##### API Endpoints
Start the Flask development server:

```
python app.py
```

The API endpoints will be available at http://localhost:5000. Here are the main endpoints:

- GET /wines: Get a list of all wines.
- GET /wines/<wine_id>: Get details about a specific wine.
- POST /wines: Add a new wine (authentication required).
- PUT /wines/<wine_id>: Update information about a specific wine (authentication required).
- DELETE /wines/<wine_id>: Delete a wine (authentication required).
  
#### Command Line Application
Run the command line application to guess the country/state of a random wine:

```
python cli.py play
```

Follow the prompts to make your guesses and see how well you know your wine regions!
